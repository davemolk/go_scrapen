# go_scrapen
This is going to be both a sandbox for scraping and a repo for some larger scrapers/crawlers/etc. Also a learning space for Go, so I'll continue building up the crawlers, making them more robust, etc...

# folder organization
inProgress: on-going, typically larger scale, projects

library: a resource for notes and examples

sandbox: throw-away scripts, typically deleted after working things out
